## 📦 How to Run the Game

1. **Download the game file** (`Alien Invasion (version 1.0).zip`).
1. **Unpack the zipped game folder** (it should contain an `AlienInvasion.exe` file and an assets folder with files like `high_score.json` and `images/`). ⚠ Do not touch these files. They are critical for the game to run properly.
3. Open the folder and **double-click** on: AlienInvasion.exe


## 🎮 Controls

- **← / → Arrow Keys**: Move spaceship left/right  
- **Spacebar**: Fire bullets  
- **Q**: Quit the game

## 🕹️ Objective

- Shoot all the incoming aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen.
- The game gets faster with each level.
- Try to beat your previous High Score every time you play.
- You have 3 lives — protect your ship and survive as long as you can!

---

## 📁 Included Files

The downloaded game folder should contain:

				alien_invasion/ (The base folder)
				├── alien_invasion.exe # The game executable
				├── README.md # This file
				└── assets
					├──  images/ # Image assets (aliens, ship)
					└── high_score.json
> 🔔 Do not delete or move the `images/` folder or `json` file — the game needs them to run properly.

---

## ❌ Troubleshooting

- If nothing happens when you run the game:
  - Try **right-clicking > Run as administrator**
  - Make sure **assets/** folder is in the same directory as the `.exe`
- If antivirus blocks it: It’s a false positive due to the nature of packaged `.exe` files from Python scripts.
 You need to add the .exe file to  allowed / whitelist for the antivirus.
